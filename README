mean-session6-master is taken from the usual zip that Daniel creates.  The files are in mean-session6-master directory on my laptop.  There is a master branch containing the original files and a version1 branch containing my files at the end of class my files with the completed homework.

mean-session6-version1 is Daniel's completed version of the homework.  There is NO git repository in this directory. 

I only have one repository on github.com for session6.  The branches match what I have locally in mean-session6-master.
